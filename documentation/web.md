# Web Development Guide

This guide describes how to build the Apex Air Angular web application. Read `../CLAUDE.md` and `system-overview.md` first to understand the domain model and capabilities before writing any code.

## Shared Components

Reusable UI components live in `components/`. Import and declare them in the `imports` array of any standalone page component that needs them — do not re-implement the same UI inline.

### `AirportComboboxComponent` — `components/airport-combobox/airport-combobox.ts`

**Use this component any time a form field needs an airport selection.** Do not build a bespoke airport input or dropdown.

The component implements `ControlValueAccessor` so it integrates with Angular's `ngModel` and reactive forms. The bound value is always the 3-letter IATA airport code (e.g. `'LHR'`). Filtering, dropdown state, and click-outside detection are all handled internally.

**Inputs**

| Input | Type | Default | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| `inputId` | `string` | `'airport'` | Forwarded to the inner `<input id>` — set this so a parent `<label for="...">` works correctly |
| `placeholder` | `string` | `'City or code'` | Placeholder text for the search input |

**Usage with a plain property**

```html
<div class="field">
  <label for="origin-input">From</label>
  <app-airport-combobox
    inputId="origin-input"
    placeholder="City or code"
    [(ngModel)]="origin"
    name="origin">
  </app-airport-combobox>
</div>
```

**Usage with an Angular signal**

```html
<div class="field">
  <label for="airport-input">Departure Airport</label>
  <app-airport-combobox
    inputId="airport-input"
    placeholder="City or airport code"
    [ngModel]="departureAirport()"
    (ngModelChange)="departureAirport.set($event)"
    name="departureAirport">
  </app-airport-combobox>
</div>
```

**Import**

```typescript
import { AirportComboboxComponent } from '../../components/airport-combobox/airport-combobox';

@Component({
  standalone: true,
  imports: [/* ... */, AirportComboboxComponent],
})
```

## Routing Conventions

Routes are defined in `app.routes.ts`. Follow these conventions:

- Top-level pages use eager-loaded components for routes that are always reachable from the nav bar (e.g. `HomeComponent`, `CheckInComponent`).
- Multi-step flow sub-pages use **lazy-loaded components** via `loadComponent`:

```typescript
{ path: 'step-name', loadComponent: () => import('./pages/flow/step/step').then(m => m.StepComponent) }
```

- Flow routes are grouped under a parent path with `children`:

```typescript
{
  path: 'flow-name',
  children: [
    { path: '', component: FlowEntryComponent },
    { path: 'step-one', loadComponent: () => ... },
    { path: 'step-two', loadComponent: () => ... },
  ]
}
```

- Unknown paths redirect to `''` via `{ path: '**', redirectTo: '' }`.
- New route groups must be added to `app.routes.ts` and must match the flow described in `design/<domain>.md` for that capability.

## API Services

### Retail API service (`retail-api.service.ts`)

The primary HTTP client for the Retail API (Booking, Search, Orders, Check-in, Manage Booking, SSR, Seatmaps). Inject it into page components that need to call these endpoints.

All methods map directly to endpoints defined in `api-reference.md`. Before adding a new method, check `api-reference.md` to confirm the endpoint exists and verify the correct HTTP verb.

### Loyalty API service (`loyalty-api.service.ts`)

HTTP client for the Loyalty API (authentication, registration, profile, points). Inject it into loyalty-flow page components.

### Adding a new API service method

1. Check `api-reference.md` — confirm the endpoint exists and note its verb, path, and request/response shape.
2. Check `models/` — add or extend a TypeScript interface that matches the API response exactly (camelCase field names).
3. Add the method to the relevant service, using `HttpClient` and the correct `Observable<T>` return type.
4. Inject the service into the component that needs it — do not call `HttpClient` directly from components.

---

## State Management

Multi-step flows use dedicated state services with `BehaviorSubject` to share data across route boundaries without passing it through route params.

| Service | Flow |
|---------|------|
| `booking-state.service.ts` | Search → Basket → Passengers → Seats → Bags → Payment → Confirmation |
| `manage-booking-state.service.ts` | Retrieve order → Detail → Seat/Bag/Change/Cancel actions |
| `check-in-state.service.ts` | Retrieve booking → Details → Bags → Seats → Payment → Boarding pass |
| `loyalty-state.service.ts` | Login → Account → Points |

Follow this pattern for new flows:

```typescript
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class NewFlowStateService {
  private _state = new BehaviorSubject<NewFlowState | null>(null);
  state$ = this._state.asObservable();

  setState(state: NewFlowState) { this._state.next(state); }
  clearState() { this._state.next(null); }
}
```

State services should hold only the data needed to progress through the flow. Do not store sensitive card data in state.

---

## Component Conventions

All components are **standalone** (Angular 21, no NgModules):

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-component-name',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule, RouterModule, /* other standalone components */],
  templateUrl: './component-name.html',
  styleUrl: './component-name.css'
})
export class ComponentNameComponent { }
```

Naming:
- Component class: `PascalCaseComponent`
- Selector: `app-kebab-case`
- Files: `kebab-case.ts`, `kebab-case.html`, `kebab-case.css`
- Directory: `pages/<flow>/<step>/`

Do not create components that call API services directly — delegate API calls to a service method and state updates to a state service.

---

## TypeScript Models

Models in `models/` are TypeScript interfaces that mirror the API response contracts defined in `api-reference.md`. Keep them in sync:

- Use camelCase for all property names (matching the JSON responses).
- Use `number` for monetary amounts and always pair with a `currency: string` field.
- Use `string` for ISO 8601 timestamps — Angular templates and `Date` pipes handle conversion.
- Use `string` for IATA codes (airport codes, passenger types, aircraft types).
- Export every interface from its model file for import elsewhere.

## Adding New Capability to the Web Application

Follow this workflow when implementing a new feature in the web app:

1. **Read `system-overview.md` and `design/<domain>.md`** — identify the domain capability you are implementing and the user journey it supports.
2. **Read `api-reference.md`** — identify all API endpoints the new pages will consume. Confirm they exist before building the UI.
3. **Read `web.md` (this file)** — confirm which existing service, state service, or model you can reuse before creating new ones.
4. **Create the route group** in `app.routes.ts` following the conventions above.
5. **Add or extend a state service** if the capability is a multi-step flow.
6. **Add API service methods** for each endpoint the flow uses.
7. **Add TypeScript models** in `models/` for any new request/response shapes.
8. **Create page components** under `pages/<flow>/`, one per route step.
9. If the capability requires new backend endpoints that do not yet exist, design them in `design/<domain>.md` and `api-reference.md` first — see `../CLAUDE.md` for the full design workflow.

---

## Development Commands

```bash
# Serve locally
ng serve

# Build for production
ng build

# Run unit tests
ng test

# Run end-to-end tests
ng e2e

# Generate a new standalone component
ng generate component pages/flow/step/step-name
```

The development server runs at `http://localhost:4200/` and hot-reloads on file changes.

## Cross-References

- **Domain capability model** — `system-overview.md` and `design/<domain>.md`: which capabilities exist and what they do — drive the UI from this.
- **API endpoints** — `api-reference.md`: every endpoint the web app can call; verify verb, path, and shape before coding.
- **Backend implementation** — `api.md`: how backend APIs are built; useful when a needed endpoint does not exist yet.
- **Architecture rules** — `principles/architecture-principals.md`: the web app is a channel consumer — it talks to orchestration APIs only, never to microservices directly.
- **Integration conventions** — `principles/integration-principals.md`: error codes, correlation IDs, and response formats to handle in the UI.
